   <p><b><i>SHYTBOX</i></b></p>

<p><i>SHYTBOX</i> was prompted by the neurolinguistic programming technique called ‘framing’; by replaying a memory in your mind and changing aspects of it — for instance, imagining it framed in an art gallery, badly lit and with others standing in front of it — you can change the emotions associated with it. To me, this seems all at once to be useful and dangerous. <i>SHYTBOX</i> produces a similar effect aurally; speak into it a memory, thing, place, person, emotion, personality quirk, or some other source of unpleasantness, and it will grind it up for you until it’s unrecognizable.</p>

<p>It could also be:<br>
— a sound toy<br>
— a broken looper pedal<br>
— much, much more (???).</p>

<p>Its name comes from a car license plate I saw once, which had apparently done enough to escape the DMV’s censor. It references <i>SHYTBOX</i>'s original purpose; it’s there for you when you have some shit you want to put in a box and throw away.</p>
<p><i>SHYTBOX</i> is programmed in <a href="https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd" target="_blank">WebPD</a>. </p>
